                <h3>Electronic code lock</h3>
                <p>An Electronic Code Lock is a security system that uses a keypad or digital interface to unlock a door or device with a predefined numeric or alphanumeric code. It enhances security by eliminating the need for physical keys and can be integrated with microcontrollers, biometric scanners, or smart systems for advanced access control.</p>

                    <p>An Electronic Code Lock is a modern security mechanism that requires users to enter a specific code to gain access to a secured area or device. Unlike traditional locks that rely on physical keys, electronic code locks use digital circuits, microcontrollers, or keypads for authentication.</p>

                <h3>Sudoku Solver Using Matlab</h3>
                <p>A Sudoku Solver using MATLAB is a program that automates the solving of Sudoku puzzles by implementing algorithms such as backtracking, constraint propagation, or optimization techniques. MATLABâ€™s matrix manipulation capabilities make it ideal for handling the 9x9 Sudoku grid, efficiently finding valid number placements while ensuring the puzzle's constraints are met.</p>

                <div class="project-details">
                    <p>MATLAB's powerful matrix operations and logical indexing make it an excellent tool for implementing Sudoku-solving techniques. The most common method used is the backtracking algorithm, which recursively places numbers and backtracks if conflicts arise. More advanced solvers incorporate constraint propagation and optimization techniques for improved efficiency.

                        This MATLAB-based solver is useful for puzzle enthusiasts, AI research, and algorithm development, providing an interactive and efficient way to solve Sudoku puzzles programmatically.</p>
